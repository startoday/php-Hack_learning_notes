1. dollar sign  $x for variable name. If without "$" sign, things can behave weird, eg: $y = x + 2 , x can be a default 0
2. single quotes and double quotes behaves differently.
    - can use \' to escape ' in single quotes.
    - single quotes will not expand \n as a new line
    - single quotes will not expand $variable as well  
3. for comments: can use // , /* */, #
4. echo can do similar thing like print, but it can take multiple parameters without parentheses eg : echo $x, "\n"
